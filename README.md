 Task 1 Software configuration

    Subtask1 Why did I choose to participate in the challenge portfolio?
        Hi, my name is Stanislav and this January I've started my transition to become a QA engineer. Since then I was participating in different QA schools that was mostly focused on manual testing. I always thought that many tasks (i.e. regression testing) should be done automatically. Last week I've started my first real, although non-comercial project, and now I'm totally convinced that I need to automize as many tasks as I could since my team is pretty big, my experience is pretty poor and commits..COMMITS.. ahh idk what to say.. let's just say that I will be very glad if I could make a big work once and then tweak it just a little later from time to time. 

        I want to study automatization with Python since I didn't really liked JS automatization (I've tried just a little mocha and chai). I'm still researching the right approach to automize my tasks as QA so I was really thrilled after applying to this Challenge and when I saw confirmation letter from you, so thank You!

        If everything will be good I would like to participate in some internship, although my primary goal is studying.
